[1] Semantics of sigchld: 

What if another child terminates while executing sigchild handler?
At least in python, some signals seem lost. see sigch_test.py

[2] SSH/RSH behavior

	ssh command

does not close its standard out when command does. To see this,
write the following program

#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
  fprintf(stdout, "hello\n");
  fclose(stdout);
  sleep(5);
}

and run:

	/full/path/a.out | wc
and
	ssh host /full/path/a.out | wc

The former immediately outputs wc's result. For the latter, it is
output only after the process terminates (5 sec. later).
