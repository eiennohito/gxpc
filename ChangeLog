	* ChangeLog : after release 3.07 started
2010-03-10 Taura
	* gxpmake/gxp_make_mapred.mk :
	* gxpmake/ex_partitioner : new mapreduce implementation that does not 
	create many intermediate files
	* gxpmake/ex_exchanger : added for the new mapreduce implementation
2010-05-02 Taura
	* gxpbin/xmake : rewritten almost from scratch. major changes are
	- it now uses sqlite3 for storing job records.
	- still support other options with 
	--work_db_class (sqlite3|sqlite3_mem|mem).
	- removed many unused feaures (e.g., staging)
	- html now shows rss and load average.
	* gxpbin/xmake.2009 : old xmake
2010-05-05 Taura
	* gxpd.py (gxpd.cleanup_process) : fixed a memory leak bug in
	which task.proc_by_rid does not shrink when a process dies.
	besides obvious memory leak, this makes jobs in gxp make are
	getting slower as it runs.
2010-05-06 Taura
	* gxpc.py (login_method_configs.__init__) : fixed torque_host bug.
2010-05-12 Taura
	* ioman.py (non_interruptible_select_by_poll) : added select
	emulation by call contributed by Yoshikazu Kamoshida. Python's
	select has a limitation that it only allows fd < 1024. poll-based
	implementation does not have this restriction.
