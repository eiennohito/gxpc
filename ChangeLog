	* ChangeLog : for release 3.06 started
2009-05-23 Taura
	* gxpc.py : fixed a bug that slowly explores even after 
	--chidren_hard_limit reached. For example, when we do
	  	use ssh A B
		explore --chilidren_hard_limit 10 B 100
	the intended behavior is to grab 10 nodes and fail to
	get the remaining 90 nodes. What happens was, however,
	to get the remaining 90 very slowly (one after another).
	On tsubame, this resulted in taking 20 mins to get 130
	nodes and got killed by the admin.

	* gxpbin/xmake : fixed links from state.html -> state.txt
	and other state_xx.html's
