	* ChangeLog : for release 3.06 started
2009-05-23 Taura
	* gxpc.py : fixed a bug that slowly explores even after 
	--chidren_hard_limit reached. For example, when we do
	  	use ssh A B
		explore --chilidren_hard_limit 10 B 100
	the intended behavior is to grab 10 nodes and fail to
	get the remaining 90 nodes. What happens was, however,
	to get the remaining 90 very slowly (one after another).
	On tsubame, this resulted in taking 20 mins to get 130
	nodes and got killed by the admin. 
2009-05-23 Taura
	* gxpbin/xmake : fixed links from state.html -> state.txt
	and other state_xx.html's
2009-06-06 Taura
	* gxpbin/xmake : defined GXP_MAKE_WORK_IDX and GXP_MAKE_MKSH_PID
	in job environment
2009-08-5 Taura
	* gxpc.py : fixed an explore bug that repeats obtaining nodes one at a time
2009-08-5 Taura
	* gxpbin/su_cmd : it finally became reliable
2009-09-07 Taura
	* this_file.py : added and used by gxpc.py and inst_local.py
	* inst_local.py : it no longer requires environment variables GXP_DIR, etc.
2009-09-07 Taura
	* gxpc.py : 
	* gxpd.py : many changes to bring up the daemon through inst_local.py,
	not directly invoking gxpd.py.  this is to avoid creating many directories
	under ~/.gxp_tmp when so many hosts are explored from the root.
2009-09-07 Taura
	* gxpc.py : fixed broken --root_target_name option
2009-09-07 Taura
	* su_cmd.expect : renamed the original su_cmd (expect script) to this
	* su_cmd : a newly added python script
2009-09-18 Taura
	* ioman.py : added code to track rusage of children
	* gxpm.py : added rusage field to handle_die
	* gxpd.py : added rusage arg to handle_die
	* gxpc.py : added code to emit rusage to notify_proc_exit_fp
	* xmake : receive rusage from persistent gxpc,h. emit them in state.txt
2009-09-19 Taura
	* gxpc.py : added --log_io option 
	* xmake : record individual job output in state.html
2009-10-25 Taura
	* xmake : fixed a bug in generating parallelism.gpl. now it correctly handles 
	cases where a prallelism is constant for long time
2009-10-30 Taura
	* xmake : fixed a bug reported by masa-tanaka, that 
	xmake failed to make a link from /a/bc to /a/bd, because
	os.path.commonprefix returns /a/b, rather than the desired /a.
2009-12-28 Taura
	* gxpc.py : fixed a broken --created_daemon option reported by Kawahara-san.
	lots of refactoring around session and daemon findings.
	directory names also changed. it now uses
	/tmp/gxp-user-default/gxp-xxxxxxxx-{daemon,stdout,stderr}-host-user-...-pid
	and
	/tmp/gxp-user-default/gxp-xxxxxxxx-{daemon,stdout,stderr}-host-user-...-pid-sid
2009-12-28 Taura
	* gxpc.py : made the behavior of explore when listing the same name
	many times more intuitive. explore x x x now tries to grab x three
	times (equivalent to explore x 3).
2010-1-5 Taura
	 * gxpbin/tmsub.rb : changed (fixed) the behavior of tmsub.rb when
	 given --node parameter like n0009.  It was previously an error
	 because 0009 was considered as an octal number.  It is now 
	 interpreted as a decimal nine, which will be what most people
	 expects in this context.
	
2010-1-5 Taura
	 * gxpd.py : fixed a bug in gxpd.py, reported by murawaki-san,
	which generates a too long UNIX domain path name, especially on
	hosts that return their FQDNs with socket.gethostname().  I am
	simply working around this problem by truncating FQDNs with the
	plain hostname.  It must be fixed more rigidly so it never
	genrates a long pathname.  For now, a simple workaround.
2010-1-18 Taura
	* mksh :
	* xmake : now support --make_env option that takes a colon-separated
	list of variable names that must be passed to node commands. i.e.,
	--make_env PATH:WAO passes environment variables PATH and WAO at
	host to compute workers.
2010-1-31 Taura
	* gxpmake/* : added built-in mapreduce
	* gxpd.py : a small change to gxpd.py so it has gxpmake/ directory in PATH and PYTHONPATH
	* gxpc.py : a small change to recognize gxp mapred command
2010-1-31 Taura
	* gxpmake/* : added built-in parameter parallel
	* gxpc.py : a small change to recognize gxp mapred command
