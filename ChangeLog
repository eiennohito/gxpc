	* ChangeLog : for release 3.03 started
	* qsub_wrap (qsub_wrap_server.init) : an easier interface to pass
	options to underlying qsub (--).
	* gxpc.py (login_method_configs.__init__) : gxpc.py now takes 
	advantage of the above.
	* gxpc.py (cmd_interpreter.mk_installer_cmd) : get rid of distinction
	between --real and --prepare.

2008-07-16 Taura
	* rsh and explore now support parameter substitution. include %p% in
	rsh config and supply args with explore -a p=xxx
	* xmake, mksh : now I believe $(shell === ...) becomes completely
	unnecessary. It automatically detects whether a command is executed
	normally or within $(shell === ...).

2008-07-27 Taura
	* gxpc.py (cmd_interpreter.find_daemon_addrs2) : handle cases where
	the host is extremely slow and gxpc.py takes 20 secs to bring up.
	it now waits up to 20 secs with exponentially backoff sleep time.

	* qsub_wrap (nqs_hitachi_system_option) : fixed regexp to get jobid
	from qsub output, so it can correctly skip messages before 
	"Request ..." line.

	* xmake (xmake_server.mk_lnk) : fixed a bug that links to output
	files are broken when --state_dir is given.

	* gxpc.py (cmd_interpreter.mk_installer_cmd) :
	explore now supports --target_prefix option that specifies
	the directory of remote hosts under which gxp will be automatically
	copied.

	* xmake (xmake_server.find_matches) : 
	fixed the phenomena that xmake.log sometimes grows very large.

	* bcp (ring_connector.transfer) :
	bcp supports several options for performance tuning/investigation.

	
2008-10-10 Taura
	* expectd.py (expectd.spawn) :
	it now uses pipe, not socketpair, when creating a child process.
	this is to avoid failing to create socket in /tmp (in broken /tmp
	permission).

	* gxpc.py (cmd_interpreter.add_up_pipe):
	* gxpc.py (cmd_interpreter.add_down_pipe):
	ditto
