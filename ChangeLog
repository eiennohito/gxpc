	* ChangeLog : for release 3.06 started
2009-05-23 Taura
	* gxpc.py : fixed a bug that slowly explores even after 
	--chidren_hard_limit reached. For example, when we do
	  	use ssh A B
		explore --chilidren_hard_limit 10 B 100
	the intended behavior is to grab 10 nodes and fail to
	get the remaining 90 nodes. What happens was, however,
	to get the remaining 90 very slowly (one after another).
	On tsubame, this resulted in taking 20 mins to get 130
	nodes and got killed by the admin. 
2009-05-23 Taura
	* gxpbin/xmake : fixed links from state.html -> state.txt
	and other state_xx.html's
2009-06-06 Taura
	* gxpbin/xmake : defined GXP_MAKE_WORK_IDX and GXP_MAKE_MKSH_PID
	in job environment
2009-08-5 Taura
	* gxpc.py : fixed an explore bug that repeats obtaining nodes one at a time
2009-08-5 Taura
	* gxpbin/su_cmd : it finally became reliable
2009-09-07 Taura
	* this_file.py : added and used by gxpc.py and inst_local.py
	* inst_local.py : it no longer requires environment variables GXP_DIR, etc.
2009-09-07 Taura
	* gxpc.py : 
	* gxpd.py : many changes to bring up the daemon through inst_local.py,
	not directly invoking gxpd.py.  this is to avoid creating many directories
	under ~/.gxp_tmp when so many hosts are explored from the root.
